I wrote  Mini-Server primarily so that I could learn PHP programming without
the need to be constantly uploading files to my website in order to use my
website host's http server. Consequently, this help file only provides the bare essentials.<p>
Mini-Server has also turned out to be a useful little http web server in its own right, hence the
addition of one or two simple features such as Authentication and some simple Logkeeping. <p>
<h3>Server Root Folder</h3>
This is the 'base' folder for the server.  If the user omits a filename, the
server defaults to <b><tt>index.html</tt></b> then <b><tt>index.htm</tt></b>, in
that order.
<p>
<h3>Server Host Address &amp; Port</h3>
The default address is 'localhost' <tt>127.0.0.1</tt> but the server will
automatically detect either your LAN address, if you connect to the internet via
a router, or your internet address if you are connected directly to the internet.
<p>
<h3>PHP Properties</h3>
You need to install PHP which is available free of charge from
<font color="blue">www.php.net</font> Download the
zip binary and the Windows installer.
<p>
On Mini-Server, browse to the <tt>php.exe</tt> file. The default is 
c:\php\php.exe<p>
In the <b>Advanced</b> section, you can also ensure that Mini-Server knows
where the php.ini file is located and you can set an error timeout.<p>
<h3>Server Authentication</h3>
Not really required when Mini-Server is used as a development tool but, as
Mini-Server is a reasonable web server in its own right, authentication is
included should it be needed.<p>
